# 🍽️ Restaurant Order Analysis
This SQL project explores a sample restaurant dataset to derive meaningful insights that help optimize menu offerings, understand customer behavior, and improve operational performance.

# 📊 Project Overview
In this project, I analyzed customer orders, identified popular menu items, evaluated peak order times, and assessed overall sales performance. The goal was to use SQL to uncover patterns and trends that can guide restaurant management decisions.

# Key Techniques Used
- SQL joins and aggregations
- Filtering and grouping
- Window functions for ranking and cumulative metrics
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)

# 🧩 Dataset
Two primary tables were used:
- **menu_items**: Contains details about each item on the menu (e.g., name, category, price)
- **order_details**: Contains records of ordered items and associated order IDs

# 🎯 Project Objectives
**✅ Objective 1: Explore the menu_items Table**
- Count the number of menu items
- Identify the most and least expensive items
- Analyze item pricing across categories

**✅ Objective 2**: Explore the order_details Table
- Understand the order date range
- Count the number of items in each order
- Identify the largest orders by item count

**✅ Objective 3**: Analyze Customer Behavior
- Combine menu_items and order_details to find:
- Most and least ordered categories
- High-spending orders and purchasing trends

# 📈 Insights Gained
- Identified top-selling and least popular menu items
- Found peak ordering periods and large order patterns
- Highlighted customer preferences by category
- Surface opportunities to optimize pricing and menu layout

# 🛠️ Tool Used
- SQL (PostgreSQL/MySQL-compatible syntax)

# 📌 Conclusion
This analysis provides a data-driven foundation for restaurant decision-making. By leveraging SQL to explore and visualize data, restaurant managers can better align their offerings with customer behavior and operational needs.
